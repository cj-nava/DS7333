```{r}

library(tidyverse)

## Missing Data / Imputation Method


We check possible imputation routes by looking at our missing data.

Overall our columns do not have missing data, however if we apply listwise deletion these volumes are will add up.

```{r}

sapply(df, function(x) sum(is.na(x))) 

```

Less than 1 percent of observations are removed when apply a listwise deletion approach. Taking the path of least resistance we use only observations where the full data is known.

```{r}

df_imputed <- na.omit(df)

percent_difference <- (nrow(df)-nrow(df_imputed))/nrow(df)

print(percent_difference)

print(paste0("The number of observations prior to imputation is : ", nrow(df)))
print(paste0("The number of after listwise deletion : ", nrow(df_imputed)))

```


## Data Munging

The model we ultimately decide to use helps guide how we want to transform the data. 

Columns with strings can be transformed with one hot encoding if there are not too many classes for these features and if the model requires numeric input. A quick structure function shows us the following are data types char for strings: x24,x29,x30, and x37.

```{r}

str(df_imputed)

```

```{r}

characters <- df_imputed %>%
  select_if(is.character) %>%
  mutate(x32 = as.numeric(gsub("\\%$","",x32)),
         x37 = as.numeric(gsub("^\\$","",x37)))

head(characters)

```
